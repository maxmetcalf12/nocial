    After watching The Social Dilemna on Netflix, I decided to go off Instagram. It has been
    a huge blessing in my life, but I have felt disconnected from friends and family at times.

    As The Social Dilemna taught us, social media giants are evil. They will do anything to
    keep us on their platforms for as long as they possibly can. They use all sorts of
    gimicky hacks and tricks to make you scroll through just one more post. Every placement
    of a button, color of font, or email reminder is methodically chosen to increase your
    addiction to their platform.

  <p class="font-mono leading-normal md:text-xl text-gray-700 tracking-wide">
    However, at base level what they provide is good. Getting regular life updates from
    friends and family is awesome, but is it really so awesome that it moves you to check
    for another update every five minutes? No. You aren't addicted to your friends' lives
    -- you are addicted to the platform. The platform uses your friends as hooks, and once they have
    you hooked they will do anything to stop you from breaking free.
